# TypeScript learner repo
This repo is for learning TypeScript. It contains the code snippets and examples that I have written while learning TypeScript.

## TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and can be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.

## Installation
To install TypeScript, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can install TypeScript using npm. Run the following command to install TypeScript globally on your system.

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Usage
You can create a TypeScript file with a `.ts` extension and write your TypeScript code in it. To compile the TypeScript file, run the following command.

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```
This will generate a JavaScript file with the same name as the TypeScript file. You can run the JavaScript file using Node.js.
